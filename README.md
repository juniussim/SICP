# Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

SICP highlights the idea of abstraction as the fundamental principle of computer science, and brilliantly illustrates this principle with a series of mind-blowing examples from the functional, object-oriented, and declarative programming paradigms.

This repository contains notes taken while going through SICP, the classic text for learning programming.

Going through it as a reintroduction to programming, in order to learn programming concepts and models that i might have missed out before.
