# Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

SICP highlights the idea of abstraction as the fundamental principle of computer science, and brilliantly illustrates this principle with a series of mind-blowing examples from the functional, object-oriented, and declarative programming paradigms.

This repository contains useful resources for going through SICP as well as my own personal notes. All online resources are provided generously by UC Berkeley.

I am currently going through it as a re-introduction to programming, in order to learn programming concepts and models that i might have missed out in the past.
