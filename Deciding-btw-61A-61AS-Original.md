# Embarking on SICP

Some of you might want more information when deciding between the classic 61A taught by Brian Harvey (using the original SICP reference book) or the modern 61AS (still taught in a lisp dialect, referencing the original SICP text) or 61A (taught in python, referencing a new book called Composing Programs).

Here are some useful resources to help you decide which is more suited for you.

## Course Comparisons

Spring 2011 was the last CS 61A: Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs Class taught by Brian Harvey (aka classic CS 61A)

Should i take the modern 61A or 61AS?

TLDR:

Why does 61AS use Scheme/Racket when 61A uses Python?

The reason is that the 61AS staff believes that Scheme/Racket is a good educational language.  There is very minimal syntax - we teach you the basic structure of the language in the first day, which allows us to spend the rest of the time teaching you computer science. We can teach many different programming paradigms (functional, imperative, object oriented) and they are all fairly natural in Scheme/Racket, which makes it easy to focus on the Computer Science and less on the syntax.

On the other hand, 61A chose to use Python because there is more support for Python (since it is used more), and there is a larger community of people who know Python which makes it easier for students.  (For example, Google will be more helpful for Python than for Scheme/Racket.)

It should be said that both 61A and 61AS staff consider Python and Scheme to be good programming languages to learn (hence they show up in both courses), and that programming language choice is by far not the most important consideration when teaching introductory Computer Science.
